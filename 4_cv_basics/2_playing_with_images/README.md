## Usage

Follow these steps to build, and run the project on your machine:

1. **Navigate to the Project Folder:**  
   Move into the `2_playing_with_images` directory:
   ```bash
   cd 2_playing_with_images
   ```
   
2. **Build and Run the Project:**  
   Use the following commands to build and execute the program:
   
   ```bash
   make build SRC=<subfolder>/main.cpp
   ./playing_with_images
   ```

> **Note:** Replace `<subfolder_name>` with the appropriate subfolder name containing `main.cpp`.

## For example:
   Running the code for the 'drawing_shapes' subfolder
```bash
make build SRC=1_drawing_on_images/main.cpp
./playing_with_images
```
